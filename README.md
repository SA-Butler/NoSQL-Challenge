# NoSQL-Challenge
Challenge


This repositry contains two Jupyter notebooks as per the deliverables for the challenge using NoSQL. 
The first NoSQL_setup_starter brings in the data from the establishments JSON in the resources directory. 
The data is then prepared as per the requirements.
The second notebook NoSQL_analysis_starter performs the exploratory analysis according to the challenge requirements.
All files were uploaded to the github repositry using the appropriate command line notations. This was particularly important as the JSON file size was considerable.
